# Binary Search Algorithm – Iterative and Recursive Implementation

The **Binary Search Algorithm** is a way to find a specific item in a `sorted list` quickly. Instead of checking each item **one by one**, it works by repeatedly cutting the list in half. If the item you're looking for is in the first half, it `ignores` the **second half**, and vice versa. This process keeps narrowing down the search until the item is found. Because it halves the list each time, it’s very efficient and works in **O(logn) time**, which is much faster than checking every item.

## Real World Analogy (Searching for a Page in a Book):

<Notation type="box" color="red">
	Binary Search Explained with a Book Example (Searching for a Page) Imagine you have a large book
	and you want to find a particular page (say page 450) quickly. Instead of flipping through one
	page at a time (linear search), you can use binary search to find it much faster
</Notation>
Steps to Find Page 450 Using Binary Search:

**Step 1: Open the Middle Page**

- <Notation> Suppose the book has 1000 pages. </Notation>
- Open the middle page: Page 500.

**Step 2: Compare the Page Number**

- If Page 500 is greater than 450 → The target page is in the left half (pages 1–499).
- If Page 500 is less than 450 → The target page is in the right half (pages 501–1000).
- If Page 500 is exactly 450, we found it! 🎉

**Step 3: Repeat in the Correct Half**

- Since 450 is less than 500, we now search only in pages 1 to 499.
- Again, pick the middle page: Page 250.
- Since 450 is greater than 250, we search in pages 251 to 499.

**Step 4: Keep Narrowing Down**

- Middle of 251–499 → Page 375. (450 is greater, so search 376–499)
- Middle of 376–499 → Page 437. (450 is greater, so search 438–499)
- Middle of 438–499 → Page 468. (450 is smaller, so search 438–467)
- Middle of 438–467 → Page 452. (450 is smaller, so search 438–451)
- Middle of 438–451 → Page 449. (450 is greater, so search 450–451)
- Middle of 450–451 → Page 450! Found it! ✅

## What is Binary Search Algorithm?

Binary search is an efficient method for finding a specific value in a **sorted list**.
Instead of scanning each element one by one, it speeds up the process by repeatedly **cutting the search space in half**.
The search begins by identifying the middle element of the list. If this middle element matches the target value, the search is complete.
However, if the target is smaller than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the list.
Conversely, if the target is larger, the search shifts to the right half.
This process repeats until the target is found or the search space becomes empty.
By reducing the number of elements to check at each step, binary search is significantly faster than a linear search, making it ideal for large datasets

The Binary Search Algorithm is a quick way to find a number in a sorted list by repeatedly cutting the search space in half.

## Interactive Example:

<BinarySearchExample client:load="true" />

<div
	className="hidden"
	style={{
		visibility: "hidden",
		width: 0,
		height: 0,
	}}
>
	### Here's how it works step by step: 1. Find the `middle element` of the list. 2. Compare it
	with the number you're searching for (the key). 3. If it `matches`, you've found the number! 4.
	If the key is `smaller` than the middle element, search only the `left`half of the list. 5. If
	the key is `larger`, search only the `right` half. 6. Keep repeating this process until you find
	the number or run out of elements to check. Since the search space gets smaller with each step,
	Binary Search is much faster than checking every number one by one!

# Binary Search Algorithm (Recursive Approach)

Given a sorted array `A` of `n` elements and a target value `T`, we find the index of `T` using recursion.

## Steps:

1. **Define the recursive function**

    - The function takes `A`, `T`, `start`, and `end` as inputs.
    - If `start > end`, that means the element is not present, so return `-1`.

2. **Find the middle element**

    - Calculate `mid = start + (end - start) / 2` to avoid integer overflow.

3. **Compare the middle element with the target**

    - If `A[mid] == T`, return `mid` because we found the element.
    - If `A[mid] > T`, that means the element is in the **left half**, so call the function again with `end = mid - 1`:
        ```cpp
        return binarySearch(A, T, start, mid - 1);
        ```
    - If `A[mid] < T`, the element must be in the **right half**, so call the function with `start = mid + 1`:
        ```cpp
        return binarySearch(A, T, mid + 1, end);
        ```

4. **Recursion continues**

    - The function keeps calling itself with smaller and smaller parts of the array.
    - Either we find the target, or we reach the base case (`start > end`), which means the element is not in the array.

5. **Final answer**
    - If found, return `mid`.
    - Otherwise, return `-1` to indicate that the target is missing.

## Iterative vs Recursive Binary Search

| Approach      | Implementation                                 | Space Complexity                      | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Iterative** | Uses a `while` loop to narrow the search range | **O(1)** (constant extra space)       | **O(log n)**    |
| **Recursive** | Calls itself with updated `S` and `E`          | **O(log n)** (due to recursive stack) | **O(log n)**    |

### **Key Differences:**

- The **iterative approach** is more space-efficient since it avoids recursive function calls.
- The **recursive approach** is easier to understand but consumes extra space due to recursion.
- Both approaches have the same **O(log n)** time complexity.

## Why do we use `mid = s + (e - s) / 2` in C++?

- In **Python**, we can use `mid = s + (e - s) // 2` to prevent overflow.
- However, in **C++**, the range of `int` is `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.
- If we calculate `mid = (s + e) / 2`, it may cause **integer overflow** for large values of `s` and `e`.
- To prevent this, we use the formula:

```python
Execute The code below to see the difference between the two methods
# [                          (x-1)       x          ]
#                            2^31 - 2   2^31 - 1
s = 2**31 - 2
e = 2**31 - 1

print("int max: ", 2**31 - 1)               # -> 2147483647
print("normal way: ", s + e / 2)            # -> 3221225469.5
print("modified way: ", s + (e - s) / 2)    # -> 2147483646.5
```
