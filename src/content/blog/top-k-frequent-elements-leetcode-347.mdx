# Top K Frequent Elements

Imagine you're analyzing data from a music streaming service. You want to find the top 3 most played songs from a playlist. That's exactly what this problem helps us solve - finding the k most frequent elements in a list!

## Problem Statement

<DataTable
	data={[
		{ id: 347, name: "Top K Frequent Elements", difficulty: "Medium" },
		{ id: 692, name: "Top K Frequent Words", difficulty: "Medium" },
		{ id: 703, name: "Kth Largest Element", difficulty: "Easy" },
		{ id: 215, name: "Kth Largest Element in Array", difficulty: "Medium" },
		{ id: 973, name: "K Closest Points to Origin", difficulty: "Medium" },
	]}
	columns={[
		{ key: "id", header: "ID", sortable: true },
		{ key: "name", header: "Name", sortable: true },
		{ key: "difficulty", header: "Difficulty", sortable: true },
	]}

## Solution Approaches

Let's explore different ways to solve this problem using various programming languages:

<CodeTabs
  tabs={{
    python: injectCode(`
      from collections import Counter
      import heapq

      def topKFrequent(nums, k):
          # Count frequencies
          count = Counter(nums)

          # Keep k most frequent elements using min-heap
          heap = []
          for num, freq in count.items():
              heapq.heappush(heap, (freq, num))
              if len(heap) > k:
                  heapq.heappop(heap)

          # Extract results
          return [num for freq, num in heap]
    `),

    'c++': injectCode(`
      class Solution {
      public:
          vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
              unordered_map<int, int> count;
              for (int num : nums) {
                  count[num]++;
              }

              priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
              for (auto& pair : count) {
                  pq.push({pair.second, pair.first});
              }

              vector<int> result;
              while (k--) {
                  result.push_back(pq.top().second);
                  pq.pop();
              }
              return result;
          }
      };
    `),

    java: injectCode(`
      import java.util.HashMap;
      import java.util.Map;
      import java.util.PriorityQueue;

      class Solution {
          public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
              Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
              for (int num : nums) {
                  count.put(num, count.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
              }

              PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
              for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : count.entrySet()) {
                  pq.offer(new int[] {
                          entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()
                  });
              }

              int[] result = new int[k];
              for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                  result[i] = pq.poll()[0];
              }
              return result;
          }
      }
    `)

}}

## Step-by-Step Explanation

Let's walk through the solution using a concrete example:

Input: `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`, `k = 2`

1. First, we count the frequencies of each number:

    ```python
    count = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}
    ```

2. Process each number-frequency pair through the heap:

    - Add (3,1): heap = [(3,1)]
    - Add (2,2): heap = [(2,2), (3,1)]
    - Add (1,3): heap = [(2,2), (3,1)] # (1,3) gets removed as it's smallest

3. Final result: `[1,2]` - these are the two most frequent elements

## Time and Space Complexity

Let's analyze the efficiency of our solution:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k)

    - Counting frequencies: O(n)
    - Heap operations: O(log k) for each unique number
    - Where n is the length of input array

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - HashMap to store frequencies: O(n)
    - Heap to store k elements: O(k)
    - Since k â‰¤ n, overall space is O(n)

## Real-World Applications

This algorithm pattern is incredibly useful in various real-world scenarios:

1. **Content Recommendations**

    - Finding most-watched videos
    - Identifying trending hashtags
    - Suggesting popular products

2. **System Monitoring**

    - Tracking frequent error codes
    - Identifying high-traffic IP addresses
    - Monitoring resource usage patterns

3. **Data Analysis**
    - Finding most common customer behaviors
    - Analyzing peak usage periods
    - Identifying popular search terms

## Key Takeaways

1. Hash maps are perfect for counting frequencies efficiently
2. Heaps help us maintain top k elements with optimal performance
3. This pattern can be applied to find top k of anything - words, users, events
4. Consider using Counter in Python for simplified frequency counting
5. Priority queues in different languages offer similar functionality with different syntax

## Practice Problems

To master this concept, try these related problems:

<DataTable
	data={[
		{ id: 692, name: "Top K Frequent Words", difficulty: "Medium" },
		{ id: 703, name: "Kth Largest Element", difficulty: "Easy" },
		{ id: 215, name: "Kth Largest Element in Array", difficulty: "Medium" },
		{ id: 973, name: "K Closest Points to Origin", difficulty: "Medium" },
		{ id: 347, name: "Top K Frequent Elements", difficulty: "Medium" },
	]}
	columns={[
		{ key: "id", header: "ID", sortable: true },
		{ key: "name", header: "Name", sortable: true },
		{ key: "difficulty", header: "Difficulty", sortable: true },
	]}

Remember: The key to mastering these problems is understanding when to use hash maps for counting and heaps for maintaining top k elements efficiently.
