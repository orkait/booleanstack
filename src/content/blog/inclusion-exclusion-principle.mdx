# Inclusion-Exclusion Principle in Competitive Programming

The **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (IEP)** is a fundamental combinatorial technique frequently used in **competitive programming** to efficiently count elements satisfying at least one condition. This principle is particularly useful when direct iteration is inefficient due to a large input size.

<Notation type="box" color="red">
	**Core Idea:** Imagine counting people at a party. If some individuals belong to multiple friend
	circles, they might be counted more than once. The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle helps correct
	this by subtracting overlaps, ensuring each person is counted only once.
</Notation>

## Understanding IEP with a Two-Way Venn Diagram

Given two sets:

- **S₂**: Contains numbers divisible by 2.
- **S₃**: Contains numbers divisible by 3.

We need to determine how many numbers in the range `[1, N]` are divisible by **either 2 or 3**.

<CodeTabs
    isTabHeaderVisible={false}
    tabs={{
        python: injectCode(`
            N = 20
            S2 = {2, 4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}   <-- Multiples of 2
            S3 = {3, 6,  9, 12, 15, 18}                   <-- Multiples of 3
            S2 ∩ S3 = {6, 12, 18}                         <-- Common multiples (LCM(2,3) = 6)

            Formula:
            |S₂ ∪ S₃| = |S₂| + |S₃| - |S₂ ∩ S₃|

            Calculations:
            |S2| = floor(20 / 2) = 10
            |S3| = floor(20 / 3) = 6
            |S2 ∩ S3| = floor(20 / 6) = 3   <-- Multiples of LCM(2,3)

            Result:
            |S₂ ∪ S₃| = 10 + 6 - 3 = 13
        `)
    }}

/>

### Why Does This Work?

<SingleImg shouldContain width="50%" src="https://i.imgur.com/XUwAeoo.png" />- **|A|** is counted
once. - **|B|** is counted once. - **|A ∩ B|** is counted twice, so we subtract it once. - This
adjustment gives us the correct count.

## **Extending to Three-Way IEP**

We can expand this principle for three sets:

<CodeTabs
	isTabHeaderVisible={false}
	tabs={{
		python: injectCode(`
        3-way IEP |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 
            +   (|A| + |B| + |C|)
            -   (|A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C|)
            +   (|A ∩ B ∩ C|)
        `),
	}}
/>

If we apply the same logic, the pattern continues as we introduce more sets.

## **IEP for Four-Way Venn Diagram**

<SingleImg class="bg-white" shouldContain src="https://i.imgur.com/ZPm6qJO.png" />

Applying four-way Inclusion-Exclusion:

<CodeTabs
	isTabHeaderVisible={false}
	tabs={{
		python: injectCode(`
        4-way IEP |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 
            +   (|A| + |B| + |C| + |D|)
            -   (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ D| + |B ∩ C| + |B ∩ D| + |C ∩ D|)
            +   (|A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D|)
            -   |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|
        `),
	}}
/>

**The pattern of + and - signs continues similarly for five-way, six-way, and beyond.**

For a **five-way set union**, the formula expands further:

<CodeTabs
	isTabHeaderVisible={false}
	tabs={{
		python: injectCode(`
        5-way IEP |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D ∪ E| = 
            +   (
                    |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E|
                )
            -   (
                    |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ D| + |A ∩ E| +
                    |B ∩ C| + |B ∩ D| + |B ∩ E| + |C ∩ D| +
                    |C ∩ E| + |D ∩ E|
                )
            +   (
                    |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ E| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + 
                    |A ∩ C ∩ E| + |A ∩ D ∩ E| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ E| + 
                    |B ∩ D ∩ E| + |C ∩ D ∩ E|
                )
            -   (
                    |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ E| + |A ∩ B ∩ D ∩ E| + 
                    |A ∩ C ∩ D ∩ E| + |B ∩ C ∩ D ∩ E|
                )
            +   (
                    |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D ∩ E|
                )
        `),
	}}
/>

## Applying IEP in a Competitive Programming Problem (from codeforces):

<Paper>
	### **Problem Statement (A) Insomnia Cure** One dragon 🐉. Two dragons 🐉🐉. Three dragons
	🐉🐉🐉... — the princess 👸 was counting. She had trouble falling asleep 😴, and she got bored
	of counting lambs 🐑 when she was nine. However, just counting dragons was boring as well, so
	she entertained herself as best she could. Tonight she imagined that all dragons were here to
	steal her 🏰, and she was fighting them off. Every k-th dragon got punched in the face with a
	frying pan 🍳. Every l-th dragon got his tail shut into the balcony door 🚪. Every m-th dragon
	got his paws trampled with sharp heels 👠. Finally, she threatened every n-th dragon to call her
	mom 📞, and he withdrew in panic 😨. How many imaginary dragons suffered moral or physical
	damage tonight, if the princess counted a total of d dragons? 🐉💥
</Paper>

#### **Input:**

```cpp
k1 = 2  (punched every 2 days)
k2 = 3  (punched every 3 days)
N = 12
```

#### **Affected Days:**

```cpp
{2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12}
```

#### **Output:**

```cpp
8
```

#### **Approach:**

- **Brute Force:** Iterate over all dragons and check if they are affected by any of the princess's actions.
- **Optimized:** Use the IEP to count the dragons affected by at least one action.

### **Dry Run:**

- **Affected Days:** `{2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12}`
- **Affected by k:** `{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}`
- **Affected by l:** `{3, 6, 9, 12}`

- **Affected by k and l:** `{6, 12}`
- **Affected by k or l:** `{2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12}`
- **Affected by k or l:** `8`

### **Implementation:**
